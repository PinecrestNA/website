    <h2>What is a neighborhood association?</h2>
    <p>
        A neighborhood association is a group of neighbors who work together to improve and maintain the quality of life in their neighborhood. Neighborhood associations are recognized by the City of Tucson and can be a powerful voice for the neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
        Neighborhood Associations are not Homeowners Associations. 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Homeowners Associations are mandatory organizations with legal power to enforce rules within a development.
            </li>
            <li>
                Neighborhood Associations are voluntary organizations comprised of property owners, renters, and businesses within the neighborhood that generally focus on community advocacy and/or community.
            </li>
