      <p class="home-text">
        In the past eight years there have been 187 traffic accidents in our
        neighborhood and 9 fatalities. We have all observed traffic driving too
        fast through our neighborhood...even near the park and the school. The
        City of Tucson has a Safe Streets Mini-Grant Program that pays for
        traffic calming features in neighborhoods. We are thinking we'd like an
        additional speed hump on Arcadia and two speed humps on Fairmount.
