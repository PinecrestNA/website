      We collected responses to a survey about forming a neighborhood association from November 2023 through March 2024. The survey had 53 responses to the question about interests in forming a neighborhood association. The following chart shows the responses that had more than one reply.

      On 23 March 2024, we had an informational get-together in Pinecrest Park. In addition to voting to approve the proposed name and boundaries for the neighborhood association, we had a board where attendees could post notes about the things they would like to see happen in the neighborhood. Here are the results.
